This repository contains several programs for recording synchronised iEEG and audio signals for different cognitive tasks involving language production. In particular, the following programs are available:

   1. single_words.py: Production of single words (e.g., vowel-consonant-vowels syllables) for two tasks: spoken words and imagined words.

   2. picture_naming.py: Naming of pictures belonging to different semantic categories. Two tasks are considered: spoken words and imagined words.

To run the programs listed above, follow these instructions:

1. Run the LSL LabRecorder program:
  > labrecorder

2. Run the LSL AudioCapture program and link it:
  2a. Run audiocapture:
      > audiocapture
  2b. Set the following parameters:
      Sample Rate: 44100
      Sample size: 16
      Channels: 1
      Buffer size: 100 ms
  2c. Press Link in the user interface

3. Set the USB serial port permissions as follows:
  > sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0

  where /dev/ttyACM0 is the device for the USB port. Use list_usb_ports.sh to find the USB port you are using.

4. Run the stimuli presentation software (e.g. single_words.py):
  > ./single_words

5. Start recording the streams with LabRecorder:
   5a. Select all streams:
       i/ Update and the select all streams from "Record from streams". There must be at least 2 streams: MyAudioStream and that for the stimuli presentation software.

   5b. Modify the information from the participant as need.

   5c. Press start to start saving the streams in a xdf file.
